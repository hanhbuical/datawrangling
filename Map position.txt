According to Wikipedia, Ho Chi Minh City (commonly known as Saigon) is a city in southern Vietnam famous for the pivotal role it played in the Vietnam War. It's also known for its French colonial landmarks, including Notre-Dame Cathedral, made entirely of materials imported from France, and the 19th-century Central Post Office. Food stalls line the city’s streets, especially around bustling Bến Thành Market.
This map is about my hometown, and I also speak Vietnamese, so I think it will be helpful for the analysis process, and I'd like to contribute to its improvement
